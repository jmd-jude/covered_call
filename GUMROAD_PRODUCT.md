## Product Description

### Transform Your Long-Term Stocks Into Cash-Flowing Assets

Stop letting your portfolio sit idle. If you're holding quality stocks for years anyway, why not collect monthly income while you wait?

**This is rental income for your stock portfolio** - except you can start today, no tenants, no maintenance, no property taxes.

**Perfect For Long-Term Investors Who:**
âœ… Own stocks they're never selling anyway  
âœ… Want liquid cash from illiquid holdings  
âœ… Treat their portfolio like income-producing real estate  
âœ… Are happy when the "worst case" is stocks going up too much  

**The Strategy:**
Sell covered calls with 84% mathematical probability of keeping the premium. When it "fails," it's because your stocks rallied so much that the portfolio gains far exceed the small premium you gave up.

**It's as close to free money as exists in the markets.**

**What You Get:**
ðŸŽ¯ One-command installation (works on Mac & Linux)  
ðŸŽ¯ AI integration with Claude Desktop  
ðŸŽ¯ 84% probability-based recommendations  
ðŸŽ¯ Professional report generation  
ðŸŽ¯ Multi-timeframe analysis  
ðŸŽ¯ No subscriptions, buy once use forever  

**What You'll Need:**
- Basic familiarity with covered call options trading
- Stock ticker symbols
- Current implied volatility data (easily found on any options chain)
- 5 minutes for setup

**Sample Results:**
*"For Apple at $200 with 25% IV: Sell $210 calls, 84% chance of keeping $4/share premium over 2 weeks. If assigned, you still made $10/share on the stock plus kept the premium."*

**The Beautiful Part:**
Your only "risk" is missing out on gains above your strike price. But you still participate in most of the upside, collect the premium, and can immediately start the next cycle.

**How It Works:**
1. Download includes one-line installer
2. Integrates with Claude Desktop (free AI assistant)
3. Ask: "Calculate covered call for my Apple position"
4. Get mathematical recommendations in seconds
5. Generate professional reports for your records

**Instant Download Includes:**
- One-command installer  
- Complete setup guide  
- Options trading primer  
- Strategy examples  
- Success tracking templates  

**No Monthly Fees. No Subscriptions. Own It Forever.**

Turn your buy-and-hold portfolio into an income machine.
